## strongjobs

strongjobs is Apache2 licensed software for engineering teams to schedule
repetitive tasks in AWS. For example, monitoring dependency updates, certificate
expiration, and more.

## Deprecation notice

Strongjobs is no longer being developed. A few issues with it were identified
and were not fixable in the current state. Feel free to use this code as
reference for developing more complete tooling for running periodic tasks.

## Background

This repo is Strongarm's solution to a running a modern and easily updatable
job-scheduler on AWS EC2. Simply, it's cron in *the cloud*. It includes some
built-in jobs, but it's intended to be modified with whatever jobs you will
find useful.

Management on the host can use [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/). Invoke tasks
are specified in `[]`.

## Customizing

In all likelihood, you will want to use your own jobs. This repo is modular
enough that it's easy (if it isn't, let us know) to fork and customize for your
purposes. Start out by modifying crontab to only run the jobs you want, and add
your new jobs.

### Adding a new job
1. Add your jobs to a directory in [jobs/](jobs/).
2. Add job to [crontab](crontab).
  - Specify how often it should run.
  - Specify when it should create slack alerts.

Depending on your requirements, you might need to:
- Add secrets or configuration to `conf.env` (and add examples to
  [sample.env](sample.env)).
- Add Python dependencies to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
- Add system-level dependencies (e.g. Ubuntu packages) to
  [scripts/before-install.sh](scripts/before-install.sh).
- Add documentation in your job directory and below in the directory layout.

Of course, you'll need to push this and do a CodeDeploy `[install]` before it
starts running.

### Disabling a job
The easiest way is to comment it out in the [crontab](crontab). To remove all
traces, follow the instructions for adding a new job, doing the opposite.
Again, you'll have to push and CodeDeploy `[install]` before the job will stop.

## Deployment

### One-time setup
1. Run `CloudFormation.py`, which will write to `CloudFormation.json`.
   `[cf.make]`
2. Upload the JSON file to CloudFormation, specifying parameters. The defaults
   should be ok, and subnet doesn't matter. `[cf.create]`
3. Configure `conf.env` (see [sample.env](sample.env)).
4. Link your GitHub account to CodeDeploy (see [AWS docs](
   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/github-integ.html)).

### Regular deployment (updating)
1. Upload `conf.env` to `s3://strongjobs/strongjobs.env`. `[s3.push]` or
   `[s3.edit]`
2. Create deployment through CodeDeploy (make sure you've pushed). `[install]`
